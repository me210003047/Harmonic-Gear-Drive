# Harmonic-Gear-Drive
A strain wave gear, also called a harmonic drive, is an unusual type of mechanical gearing that offers some significant advantages over standard gear drives. These include its being smaller and lighter than ordinary gears, having high reduction ratios, and with minimum backlash they can be made to produce huge torque changes. Key components of a harmonic drive are: the wave generator; flexspline; and circular spline. The generator in most cases is an elliptical cam that causes the flexible flexspline to deform into a similar shape thereby enabling it to interact with the rigid circular spline at two points diametrically opposite each other. As the wave generator rotates, the contact points move round the circumference causing the speed of rotation of flexspline to be less compared with that of the wave generator .This leads to very high accuracy and precision which makes them applicable for use in robotics industries aerospace among others.
